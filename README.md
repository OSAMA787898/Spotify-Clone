# Spotify-Clone
I developed a responsive Spotify clone using HTML and CSS, ensuring seamless adaptability across various devices. This Spotify clone, built with HTML and CSS, includes responsive features to ensure a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. I implemented dynamic layout adjustments, such as a sidebar and main content on desktops, a two-column structure on tablets, and a single-column layout on mobile for better usability. Key enhancements include resized playlist cards, reorganized footers, and hidden elements to optimize space. You can test the responsiveness using browser developer tools
